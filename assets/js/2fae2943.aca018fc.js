You are about to embark on a journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, a field that is actively shaping the future of technology, automation, and even human experience itself. This book is your guide, your toolkit, and your companion as you learn to build intelligent machines that can perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part1/chapter2":{"id":"chapters/part1/chapter2","title":"Chapter 2: Fundamentals of ROS 2","description":"Welcome to the engine room. In the last chapter, we saw the high-level map of our \\"Mind-in-Motion\\" stack. Now, we get our hands dirty by learning the most critical piece of that stack: the Robot Operating System (ROS 2).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part1/chapter3":{"id":"chapters/part1/chapter3","title":"Chapter 3: Simulating Humanoids in Gazebo","description":"In the previous chapter, we learned the language of ROS 2. Now, we\'ll give our ROS 2 system a body and a world to live in. Welcome to Gazebo, the workhorse of the ROS ecosystem and your first step into robotics simulation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part1/chapter4":{"id":"chapters/part1/chapter4","title":"Chapter 4: Advanced Visual Simulation with Unity","description":"While Gazebo is the dependable workhorse for ROS-based simulation, there are times when you need more. When you need cutting-edge graphics, complex sensor simulations, and a rich ecosystem of assets to build a truly immersive world for your robot, you turn to a professional game engine. Welcome to Unity.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part2/chapter5":{"id":"chapters/part2/chapter5","title":"Chapter 5: NVIDIA Isaac Sim: From Simulation to Synthetic Data","description":"You have seen a ROS-native simulator (Gazebo) and a high-fidelity game engine (Unity). Now, we introduce the tool that combines the best of both worlds and pushes the state of the art: NVIDIA Isaac Sim.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part2/chapter6":{"id":"chapters/part2/chapter6","title":"Chapter 6: Vision Systems and Perception","description":"In the last chapter, we accomplished something extraordinary: we generated a perfectly labeled, randomized dataset from a simulator. This chapter is the payoff. We will take that synthetic data and use it to give our robot the gift of sight.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part2/chapter7":{"id":"chapters/part2/chapter7","title":"Chapter 7: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models","description":"Our robot can now see. But sight without understanding is just data. To build a truly intelligent agent, that sight must be connected to language and, most importantly, to action. This chapter introduces a concept from the absolute cutting edge of AI research: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part2/chapter8":{"id":"chapters/part2/chapter8","title":"Chapter 8: Conversational Robotics","description":"Our robot can now see and reason about the world through its VLA model. But to truly integrate into a human environment, it needs to communicate naturally. This chapter is dedicated to Conversational Robotics, enabling our humanoid to understand spoken commands and respond in kind. We will build a complete audio pipeline, integrating Speech-to-Text (STT), Large Language Models (LLMs) for dialogue, and Text-to-Speech (TTS).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part3/chapter10":{"id":"chapters/part3/chapter10","title":"Chapter 10: Capstone Phase 1: Building the Butler in Simulation","description":"Congratulations! You\'ve traversed the landscapes of ROS 2, explored advanced simulators, built vision systems, integrated VLA models, and even given your robot the power of conversation. Now, all that knowledge culminates in our capstone project: the Autonomous Humanoid Butler.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part3/chapter11":{"id":"chapters/part3/chapter11","title":"Chapter 11: Capstone Phase 2: Sim-to-Real Deployment","description":"Congratulations! Your Autonomous Humanoid Butler is fully functional and intelligent within the NVIDIA Isaac Sim environment. It can navigate, perceive, reason, and converse, all orchestrated by sophisticated Behavior Trees. This is a monumental achievement, and it represents the culmination of much of what you\'ve learned in this book.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapters/part3/chapter12":{"id":"chapters/part3/chapter12","title":"Chapter 12: The Future of Humanoid Robotics","description":"You have reached the end of an incredible journey.

It has learned to perceive, reason, and converse within the perfect, predictable confines of a simulator. But the ultimate goal of Physical AI is to operate in the messy, unpredictable real world. This chapter is about preparing for that leap: understanding the immense challenges of bridging the sim-to-real gap and laying the groundwork for deploying our autonomous humanoid butler on physical hardware.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book","description":"Welcome to the official companion textbook for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course \u2014 a hands-on, simulation-driven, agent-augmented learning experience designed for the next generation of AI-native robotic engineers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);

## Prompt

You are an expert technical writer and robotics educator. Your task is to write Chapter 12 of the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," titled "The Future of Humanoid Robotics."

**Reference**: `humanoid-robotics-book/plan.md`

**Instructions**:
1.  **Objective**: Conclude the book by looking ahead to the future of the field. This chapter should inspire the reader to continue their learning journey and become a contributor to the field of robotics.
2.  **Cover all topics from the plan**:
    *   **Research Frontiers**: Discuss exciting, cutting-edge research areas.
        *   **Foundation Models for Robotics / General Purpose Robots (GPR)**: Explain the push towards creating single, powerful AI models that can control many different robots.
        *   **In-the-Wild Learning**: Talk about robots that learn continuously from their experiences in the real world.
    *   **Open-Source and Community**: Emphasize the importance of the open-source community (e.g., Open Source Robotics Foundation) and encourage the reader to get involved.
    *   **Ethical Considerations**: Dedicate a thoughtful section to the societal impact of Physical AI. Discuss topics like job displacement, safety, and data privacy. This should be a balanced and nuanced discussion.
    *   **Your Career in Robotics**: Provide concrete next steps for the reader. Suggest other advanced topics to learn, communities to join, and potential career paths (e.g., Robotics Engineer, AI/ML Specialist for Robotics, Simulation Engineer).
3.  **Tone**: Inspirational, thoughtful, and forward-looking.
4.  **Final Message**: End with a powerful concluding message that congratulates the reader on completing the journey and welcomes them to the exciting field of humanoid robotics.
5.  **Output**: Produce a markdown file with the full chapter content.

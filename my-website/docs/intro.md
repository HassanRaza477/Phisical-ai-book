# Introduction to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome to the official companion textbook for the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course** — a hands-on, simulation-driven, agent-augmented learning experience designed for the next generation of AI-native robotic engineers.

This book is not a traditional robotics book.  
It is a **project-driven**, **AI-assisted**, **simulation-first**, and **LLM-integrated** learning system built for the Panaversity Hackathon.

Throughout this guide, you will build:

- Your own **Digital Twin** of a humanoid robot  
- AI-powered **perception models** trained using Isaac Sim synthetic data  
- ROS 2–based **control and locomotion pipelines**  
- A **Vision–Language–Action (VLA)** system powered by modern LLMs  
- A functional **Autonomous Humanoid** capable of planning, seeing, understanding, and acting

## 🚀 What You Will Learn in This Book

As you progress, you will master:

- Foundations of **Physical AI** and embodied intelligence  
- ROS 2: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions  
- Gazebo & Unity: Physics-driven robot simulation  
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS  
- Object detection, SLAM, VLA, perception pipelines  
- Humanoid walking, balance, and manipulation  
- Integrating GPT-powered conversational robotics  
- End-to-end system design and deployment

Every chapter includes:

- Concept breakdowns  
- Hands-on coding examples  
- Simulation workflows  
- RAG-generated hints  
- Optional agent-assisted tasks (Spec-Kit + Claude/Gemini)

## 🧰 What You Need Before Starting

Before you begin, make sure you have:

### **1. Node.js (v20+)**

Install Node.js (recommended to check all dependency checkboxes):  
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### **2. Development Environment**

You should have:

- Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended for ROS 2 + Isaac Sim)  
- VS Code with TypeScript support  
- A GPU workstation or cloud instance (optional for now)
